# hobbit-breakfast
This repository tracks a recipe website built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This project demonstrates an understanding of HTML foundations. I am able to create HTML boilerplate, create HTML code that generates items on a page, and navigate through directory heirarchy to create a 'web' of connected pages.

The recipes and images were sourced from the following links:

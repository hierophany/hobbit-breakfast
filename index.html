        <div class="expanded">In the Shire, hobbits cherish a rich morning culinary tradition, centered on breakfast,
            second breakfast, and elevenses. These rituals are celebrations of the new day and opportunities for hearty
            fellowship. From comforting breakfasts of freshly baked bread, sausages, and eggs, to lighter second
            breakfasts of fruits, cheeses, and pastries, each meal reflects the hobbits' love for good food and
            companionship. Elevenses, a mid-morning interlude, features sweet treats and savory delights paired with tea
            or ale. Together, these rituals foster a deep sense of community and joy in hobbit society.</div>
